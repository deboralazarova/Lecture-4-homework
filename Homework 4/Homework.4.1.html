                    The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly
                    <br />or indirectly,including the eight planets and five dwarf planets as defined by the International Astronomical
                    <br />Union (IAU). Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder
                    <br />being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.

                    The Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.
                    <br /> The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and
                    <br />metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest,
                    <br />Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and
                    <br />Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and
                    <br />helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.

                    The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.Composed mainly of silicates and
                    <br />metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun; the radius of this entire region is less
                    <br />than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn. This region is also within the frost line, which is a little
                    <br />less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.

                    The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets
                    <br />also orbit in this region. Due to their greater distance from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a
                    <br />higher proportion of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower
                    <br />temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.
