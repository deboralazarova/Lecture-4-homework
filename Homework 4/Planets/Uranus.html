                        Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun and the first to be discovered by scientists. Although Uranus is visible 
                        <br />to the naked eye, it was long mistaken as a star because of the planet's dimness and slow orbit. The planet is 
                        <br />also notable for its dramatic tilt, which causes its axis to point nearly directly at the sun.

                        Uranus was named after the Greek sky deity Ouranos, the earliest of the lords of the heavens. It is the only planet 
                        <br />to be named after a Greek god rather than a Roman one.

                        Uranus is blue-green in color, the result of methane in its mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere. The planet is often 
                        <br />dubbed an ice giant, since 80 percent or more of its mass is made up of a fluid mix of water, methane, and ammonia 
                        <br />ices.

                        This unusual tilt gives rise to extreme seasons roughly 20 years long, meaning that for nearly a quarter of the Uranian
                        <br />year, equal to 84 Earth-years, the sun shines directly over each pole, leaving the other half of the planet to
                        <br />experience a long, dark, cold winter. Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any of the planets in the solar system, 
                        <br />even though it is not the most distant from the sun. That's because Uranus has little to no internal heat to supplement 
                        <br />the heat of the sun.

                        With minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C Uranus is nearly coldest planet in the solar system. While Neptune doesn’t 
                        <br />get as cold as Uranus it is on average colder. The upper atmosphere of Uranus is covered by a methane haze which hides 
                        <br />the storms that take place in the cloud decks.

                            The rings of Uranus
                        </h3>
                        The rings of Uranus were the first to be seen after Saturn's. They were a significant discovery, because it helped astronomers 
                        <br />understand that rings are a common feature of planets, not merely a peculiarity of Saturn.

                        Uranus possesses two sets of rings. The inner system of rings consists mostly of narrow, dark rings, while an outer system of
                        <br />two more-distant rings, discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope, are brightly colored, one red, one blue. Scientists have
                        <br />now identified 13 known rings around Uranus. A 2016 study suggested the rings of Uranus, Saturn and Neptune may be the remnants 
                        <br />of Pluto-like dwarf planets that strayed too close to the giant worlds long ago.

                        </h3>
                        Uranus has 27 known moons. Instead of being named after figures from Greek or Roman mythology, its first four moons were named 
                        <br />after magical spirits in English literature, such as William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and Alexander Pope's 
                        <br />"The Rape of the Lock." Since then, astronomers have continued this tradition, drawing names for the moons from the works of 
                        <br />Shakespeare or Pope.

                        Oberon and Titania are the largest Uranian moons, and were the first to be discovered, by Herschel in 1787. William Lassell, who 
                        <br />was the first to see a moon orbiting Neptune, discovered the next two, Ariel and Umbriel. Then nearly a century passed before 
                        <br />Miranda was found in 1948.
