                         Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, 
                         <br />oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life.

                         Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface, and most of that is in the oceans. About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere 
                         <br />consists of oxygen, produced by plants. While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been learned 
                         <br />in recent decades by studying pictures of Earth from space.

                         While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole 
                         <br />to the South Pole. It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the 
                         <br />sun.

                         Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion years ago, when the solar 
                         <br />system coalesced from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed because of its 
                         <br />gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun.
