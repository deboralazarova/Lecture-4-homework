                        Saturn is the sixth planet from the sun and the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturn was the Roman 
                        <br />name for Cronus, the lord of the Titans in Greek mythology. Saturn is the root of the English word "Saturday."

                        Saturn is the farthest planet from Earth visible to the naked human eye, but it is through a telescope that the planet's
                        <br />most outstanding features can be seen: Saturn's rings. Although the other gas giants in the solar system — Jupiter, 
                        <br />Uranus and Neptune — also have rings, those of Saturn are without a doubt the most extraordinary.

                        Saturn is a gas giant made up mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is big enough to hold more than 760 Earths, and 
                        <br />is more massive than any other planet except Jupiter, roughly 95 times Earth's mass. However, Saturn has the lowest 
                        <br />density of all the planets, and is the only one less dense than water — if there were a bathtub big enough to hold it, 
                        <br />Saturn would float.

                        Saturn has at least 62 moons. Since the planet was named after Cronus, lord of the Titans in Greek mythology, most of 
                        <br />Saturn's moons are named after other Titans, their descendants, as well as after giants from Gallic, Inuit and Norse 
                        <br />myths.

                        Though scientists have identified many moons, the chaotic system has other small moons constantly being created and destroyed.

                        Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is slightly larger than Mercury, and is the second-largest moon in the solar system behind 
                        <br />Jupiter's moon Ganymede. (Earth's moon is the fifth largest.) Titan is veiled under a very thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere 
                        <br />that might be like what Earth's was long ago, before life.

                        The rings of Saturn have fascinated stargazers for centuries, ever since telescopes were first pointed toward the sky. Saturn's 
                        <br />rings are made up of billions of particles ranging from grains of sand to mountain-size chunks. Composed predominantly of 
                        <br />water-ice, the rings also draw in rocky meteoroids as they travel through space.

                        Though Saturn appears surrounded by a single, solid ring when viewed by an amateur astronomer, several divisions exist. The 
                        <br />rings are named alphabetically in the order of discovery. Thus the main rings are, from farthest from the planet to closest,
                        <br />A, B and C. A gap 2,920 miles wide (4,700 kilometers), known as the Cassini Division, separates the A and B rings.

                    <td>
                        Several hypotheses exist as to the how Saturn's rings were formed. Some scientists think that passing comets or asteroids were 
                        <br />snagged by the planet's gravity and broken up before reaching it.

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        Another possibility is that the rings were once large moons that spiraled into the planet. The rings are mostly ice with a little 
                        <br />bit of rock mixed in. Scientists have a better grasp of their dynamics than ever before, thanks to the Cassini spacecraft, which 
                        <br />ends its mission on Friday (Sept. 15) with a plunge into Saturn's atmosphere, after 13 years of orbiting the planet. Over that 
                        <br />time, Cassini sent unprecedented photographs of Saturn's rings earthward, giving researchers a close look at some of the odd 
                        <br />structures found amid the ice.
