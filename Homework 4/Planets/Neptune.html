                        Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun. It was the first planet to get its existence predicted by mathematical 
                        <br />calculations before it was actually seen through a telescope on Sept. 23, 1846.

                        Neptune's cloud cover has an especially vivid blue tint that is partly due to an as-yet-unidentified compound and 
                        <br />the result of the absorption of red light by methane in the planets mostly hydrogen-helium atmosphere. Photos 
                        <br />of Neptune reveal a blue planet, and it is often dubbed an ice giant, since it possesses a thick, slushy fluid 
                        <br />mix of water, ammonia and methane ices under its atmosphere and is roughly 17 times Earth's mass and nearly 58 
                        <br />times its volume, according to a NASA fact sheet.

                        Despite its great distance from the sun, which means it gets little sunlight to help warm and drive its atmosphere, 
                        <br />Neptune's winds can reach up to 1,500 mph (2,400 km/h), the fastest detected yet in the solar system. These winds 
                        <br />were linked with a large dark storm that Voyager 2 tracked in Neptune's southern hemisphere in 1989.

                        Only one mission has flown by Neptune – Voyager 2 in 1989 – meaning that astronomers have done most studies using
                        <br />ground-based telescopes. Today, there are still many mysteries about the cool, blue planet, such as why its winds
                        <br />are so speedy and why its magnetic field is offset. While Neptune is of interest because it is in our own solar 
                        <br />system, astronomers are also interested in learning more about the planet to assist with exoplanet studies. Specifically,
                        <br />some astronomers are interested in learning about the habitability of worlds that are somewhat bigger than Earth.

                        Neptune's elliptical, oval-shaped orbit keeps the planet an average distance from the sun of almost 2.8 billion miles 
                        <br />(4.5 billion kilometers), or roughly 30 times as far away as Earth, making it invisible to the naked eye. Neptune 
                        <br />goes around the sun once roughly every 165 Earth years, and completed its first orbit, since being discovered, in 2011.

                        Every 248 years, Pluto moves inside Neptune's orbit for 20 years or so, during which time it is closer to the sun than 
                        <br />Neptune. Nevertheless, Neptune remains the farthest planet from the sun, since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf 
                        <br />planet in 2006.

                        Neptune has 14 known moons, named after lesser sea gods and nymphs from Greek mythology. The largest by far is Triton,
                        <br />whose discovery on Oct. 10, 1846, was in a sense enabled by beer — amateur astronomer William Lassell used the fortune
                        <br />he made as a brewer to finance his telescopes. Triton is the only spherical moon of Neptune — the planet's other 13 
                        <br />moons are irregularly shaped. It is also unique in being the only large moon in the solar system to circle its planet 
                        <br />in a direction opposite to its planet's rotation — this "retrograde orbit" suggests that Triton may once have been a 
                        <br />dwarf planet that Neptune captured rather than forming in place, according to NASA. Neptune's gravity is dragging Triton 
                        <br />closer to the planet, meaning that millions of years from now, Triton will come close enough for gravitational forces to rip 
                        <br />it apart.

                        Neptune is generally thought to have formed with the initial buildup of a solid core followed by the capture of surrounding 
                        <br />hydrogen and helium gas in the nebula surrounding the early sun. In this model, proto-Neptune formed over the course of 
                        <br />1 to 10 million years.
